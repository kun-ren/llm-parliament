# Configuration reference

Every key the code reads, its type, its default, and what overrides it.

Values below were read out of the source, not out of the prose: `src/parliament/config.py`
(the `resolve_*` helpers, `load_config`, `load_keys`, `save_key`,
`build_parliament_from_config`), `src/parliament/providers/__init__.py`
(`create_provider`), `src/parliament/cli.py`, `src/parliament/first_run.py`,
`src/parliament/tui.py` (`SETTINGS_FILE`), `src/parliament/render/hansard.py`
(`HansardLevel`, `DEFAULT_LEVEL`) and the five provider modules under
`src/parliament/providers/`.

Last checked against `main` at `12244bf`. If a default here disagrees with the
code, the code has moved; please open an issue.

## Where things live

`PARLIAMENT_DIR` is `~/.parliament` — `%USERPROFILE%\.parliament` on Windows —
from `Path.home()`, so it does not follow `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

| Path | Written by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.parliament/config.yaml` | you, the first-run wizard, the TUI's member editor | everything on this page except `save_dir` |
| `~/.parliament/settings.json` | the TUI only | `save_dir` |
| `~/.parliament/keys.env` | `parliament keys set`, when no OS keyring is available | `NAME=value` lines; `chmod 0600` on POSIX, left as-is on Windows |
| OS keyring (service `llm-parliament`) | `parliament keys set`, when a keyring is available | API keys |
| `~/.parliament/hansards/` | each run | saved Hansards, unless `save_dir` says otherwise |

`parliament keys set` **writes** to the keyring when one is available and only
falls back to `keys.env` when it is not. `load_keys` **reads** the other way
round: `keys.env` first, then the keyring only for variables the file did not
set. So if the same variable is in both, the file wins. Neither overrides a
variable already set in the process environment.

On first run, when `~/.parliament/config.yaml` does not exist, a detection
wizard checks for API keys, a reachable Ollama and system RAM, then writes a
matching preset (an interactive run shows the proposal first, and declining it
writes the mock preset). `config.example.yaml` is copied verbatim only if the
wizard raises. `parliament ask --config <path>` reads a different file instead.

`${VAR}` anywhere in the YAML is substituted from the environment before
parsing. An unset variable is **not** an error at load time: the raw text is
parsed instead and the failure surfaces later, when the provider is
constructed. That fallback is all-or-nothing: if any one `${VAR}` is unset,
**none** of them are substituted, including the ones that are set.

## Precedence

Every resolved setting follows the same order, highest first:

```
CLI flag  >  environment variable  >  config.yaml  >  built-in default
```

## `parliament`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parliament.name` | string | — | Not read by any code. The first-run presets and `config.example.yaml` write it (`House of AI`), but nothing displays it. |
| `parliament.members` | list | **required** | `build_parliament_from_config` indexes `config["parliament"]["members"]` directly, so a missing key is a `KeyError`. |
| `parliament.members[].name` | string | **required** | Also the key each provider instance is stored under, so it must be unique. |
| `parliament.members[].provider` | string | **required** | One of `ollama`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `openrouter`, `groq`, `mistral`, `mock`. |
| `parliament.members[].model` | string | **required** | Also decides the member's tier — see [tiers](#tiers). |

A member's `tier` is **not** configurable: it is resolved from the model ID,
provider and endpoint context. See [tiers](#tiers) for unknown-model defaults
and capability-gap warnings.

## `providers`

`providers.<name>` is passed to that provider's constructor as keyword
arguments, so the accepted set is whatever that constructor takes — and an
unknown key is a `TypeError`, not a warning. It is keyed **per provider, not
per member**: two members on the same provider share one block.

| Provider | `model` | `api_key` | `base_url` | `timeout` | other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ollama` | ✅ | — | ✅ `http://localhost:11434/v1` | ✅ `null` | |
| `openai` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `null` | ✅ `null` | |
| `anthropic` | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ `null` | |
| `google` | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ `null` | |
| `openrouter` | ✅ | ✅ `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ✅ `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | ✅ `null` | |
| `groq` | ✅ | ✅ `GROQ_API_KEY` | ✅ `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | ✅ `null` | |
| `mistral` | ✅ | ✅ `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | ✅ `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` | ✅ `null` | |
| `mock` | ✅ | — | — | — | none |

`mock` takes **no** keys from this block. `create_provider` constructs it with
`model` alone and drops everything else, so `providers.mock.latency_ms` (which
`MockProvider` accepts as a constructor argument, default `50`) is silently
ignored.

`openai`'s `base_url` routes requests to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint that
does not yet have its own `provider:` value, such as a self-hosted gateway.
When it points anywhere other than OpenAI, set `api_key` in the same
block to that endpoint's key (for example `api_key: ${GATEWAY_API_KEY}`) -- leaving
it unset lets the OpenAI SDK fall back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` and send your
OpenAI credential to the other host. For Groq, Mistral and OpenRouter, prefer
`provider: groq`, `provider: mistral` and `provider: openrouter` respectively:
each has its own address and key variable, and construction refuses to borrow
`OPENAI_API_KEY` (#48).

`model` comes from the member entry and is passed for you. Setting it here as
well raises `TypeError: create_provider() got multiple values for argument
'model'` before the provider is constructed, which stops `parliament ask` and
TUI startup.

`timeout` is `null` (no limit) everywhere by default. Apart from that `base_url`
case, `api_key` is usually better left out — the provider SDKs read
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` themselves, and
`load_config` injects `keys.env` and the keyring into the environment before
anything is constructed.

```yaml
providers:
  ollama:
    base_url: http://192.168.1.10:11434/v1
    timeout: 600.0
```

## `display`

| Key | Type | Default | Overridden by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `display.show_debate` | bool | `true` | `--show-debate` / `--no-show-debate`, then `PARLIAMENT_SHOW_DEBATE` |

`PARLIAMENT_SHOW_DEBATE` is true for `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on`, compared
case-insensitively after stripping. **Anything else is false**, including
`maybe` and a typo — it is not a parse error, so `PARLIAMENT_SHOW_DEBATE=ture`
silently turns the debate view off.

## `hansard`

| Key | Type | Default | Overridden by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hansard.level` | string | `verdict` | `--hansard <level>`, then `PARLIAMENT_HANSARD_LEVEL`; `--verbose` is an alias for `--hansard=full`, applied only when `--hansard` is absent |

| Level | Includes |
| --- | --- |
| `minimal` | recommendation only |
| `verdict` | full synthesis — consensus, split, risks, recommendation |
| `archive` | `verdict` + frontmatter + session footer |
| `full` | `archive` + first-reading and debate transcripts |

Unknown values fall back to `verdict` **and emit a `UserWarning`**, so a typo in
a flag, an env var or the YAML is visible rather than silent.

## `settings.json`

Written by the TUI's Settings dialog, and by nothing else. It is separate from
`config.yaml` because it is per-machine rather than per-parliament.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `save_dir` | string | `~/.parliament/hansards` |

There is no CLI flag and no environment variable for it; to change it outside
the TUI, edit the file:

```json
{ "save_dir": "/home/you/notes/hansards" }
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Read by | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | provider SDK | Anthropic credentials |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | provider SDK | OpenAI credentials |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | provider SDK | Google credentials |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | provider SDK | OpenRouter credentials |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | provider factory and model discovery | Groq credentials |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | provider factory and model discovery | Mistral credentials |
| `PARLIAMENT_SHOW_DEBATE` | `resolve_show_debate` | overrides `display.show_debate` |
| `PARLIAMENT_HANSARD_LEVEL` | `resolve_hansard_level` | overrides `hansard.level` |
| any `${VAR}` in the YAML | `load_config` | substituted before parsing |

## Tiers

Tiers drive Speaker assignment and the gap warning, and are internal — there is
no config key for them. `MODEL_TIERS` in `src/parliament/core/model_tiers.py`
maps canonical model IDs to capability ratings. Tier lookup uses the provider
and endpoint context without changing the model ID sent to the API. For
example, `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` resolves to tier 1 both with
`provider: openrouter` and with `provider: openai` pointing at
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`.

| Tier | Label |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | frontier |
| 2 | strong |
| 3 | capable |
| 4 | small |

Unknown models receive `DEFAULT_TIER`, which is 3. This fallback is a default,
not an assessed capability rating: an unlisted model could be frontier-level
or much weaker. It retains the numeric tier and its display label, and remains
eligible for automatic Speaker selection using that fallback tier.

Capability-gap warnings compare **only models with known ratings, for every
provider**, including Ollama and Anthropic. Unknown models do
not participate in this comparison, even when their fallback tier differs from
a known model's tier. With fewer than two known models, no capability-gap
warning is produced. Otherwise, a spread greater than one tier produces a
warning naming the strongest and weakest known members.

For example, GPT-4o (tier 1) and an unknown Ollama model (fallback tier 3)
produce no gap warning. GPT-4o and known `llama3.1` (tier 3) do produce one,
including when an unknown third member is present. This changes the previous
behavior, which included unknown models' fallback tiers in gap comparisons.

Programmatically constructed mock members are an exception: their supplied
tiers are synthetic ratings used for testing and are preserved in gap
comparisons and runtime tier resolution. Known real models' comparison tiers
are resolved from the catalogue even if a directly constructed `Member` still
has its default `tier=3`.
