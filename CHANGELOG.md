## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **OpenRouter first-run preset** — detect `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and propose
  three models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google using one account. Existing
  two- and three-provider setups keep their direct presets, and three usable
  local models take priority over OpenRouter. Otherwise OpenRouter precedes
  mixed, single-provider and mock presets. Its model IDs resolve to the same
  tiers as their direct counterparts. Fixes #38.

- **Groq and Mistral providers** — use `provider: groq` or `provider: mistral`
  directly, with dedicated key management, TUI selection, and doctor checks
  for configured members.
  Fixes #48.

- **`openrouter` provider** — OpenRouter speaks the OpenAI API at its own
  address, so it needs no class of its own: it reuses `OpenAIProvider` with the
  address and the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` variable read from its
  `model_catalog.OPENAI_COMPATIBLE` row. A member can now name
  `provider: openrouter` instead of pointing `openai` at a `base_url`, and
  because `openrouter` is in `KEY_PROVIDERS`, `parliament keys set openrouter`,
  `keys list`, the TUI's `/key`, and the doctor's key check all follow with no
  further wiring. The compatible-provider registry is shared with Groq and Mistral.
  Fixes #36.

- **`degraded` on `Hansard`** — `true` when the verdict was reached with fewer
  members than configured because one or more members failed with a provider
  error. Degraded mode itself is unchanged, but `--json` consumers can now tell
  a three-member verdict from a two-member one without re-deriving it from the
  response arrays. Documented in `docs/hansard-schema.md`. Fixes the second half
  of #34.

- **`parliament --version`** — prints the installed version and exits 0, via
  Click's `version_option` (also exposed as `-V`); the version comes from
  `parliament.__version__`, which is read from package metadata so it cannot
  drift from `pyproject.toml`, falling back to `"unknown"` when running from an
  uninstalled source tree. `parliament doctor` reports it first, ahead of the
  Python line. Fixes #19. The `"unknown"` fallback and four of the tests come
  from @dchaudhari7177's #25.
- `parliament ask --json` now prints the complete Hansard object for scripts,
  with `docs/hansard-schema.md` documenting the fields and common `jq` recipes.
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `ruff` plus the full pytest suite on
  Linux, macOS, and Windows across Python 3.11-3.13 for every push and PR.
- Issue chooser links (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`) pointing at good
  first issues, Discussions, the security policy, and the contributing guide.

### Changed

- **OpenAI-compatible model discovery** no longer falls back to
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` for other vendors. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` or `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
  for the corresponding picker. Existing `provider: openai` configurations
  with an explicit vendor `base_url` and key still work for debates.

- **Default Hansard level is now `verdict`** (the full four-part synthesis),
  reversing the 0.2.0 change to `minimal`. The split — where the members
  disagreed and why — is the one output a single model cannot produce, and
  defaulting to the recommendation alone made a three-member debate read like
  an expensive single call. `config.cloud.yaml` and `config.mixed.yaml` already
  shipped `level: verdict`; the built-in default and `config.example.yaml` were
  the outliers, and the three are now pinned to agree by test.

  This affects on-screen output only: saved `.md` files are still always
  written at `archive`, and `--json` was never gated by level. `minimal` is
  unchanged and still available via `--hansard=minimal`,
  `PARLIAMENT_HANSARD_LEVEL`, or `hansard.level` in config.

  **Existing installs keep the level already written in their config.** The
  first-run wizard materializes `hansard.level`, so a config created before
  this release still says `minimal` and is left untouched — change it in the
  TUI settings screen or by editing `~/.parliament/config.yaml`.
- The default and the typo-recovery value are now one constant,
  `render.hansard.DEFAULT_LEVEL`, instead of being spelled `MINIMAL` four
  times inside `HansardLevel.parse`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` expanded — non-code ways to help, mock-only dev loop, a
  change-area-to-file map, recipes for adding a provider or slash command, and
  an explicit PR checklist.
- README gained CI / PRs-welcome / good-first-issue / help-wanted badges, a
  Contributing section, and a "For AI agents and automated tools" section.
- AGENTS.md repository layout now lists `first_run.py`, `presets.py`,
  `providers/errors.py`, `docs/`, and `.github/`.

### Fixed

- **OpenRouter endpoint tier context** — `provider: openai` with OpenRouter's
  registered endpoint now gets the same model tiers as `provider: openrouter`,
  including TUI previews, runtime Speaker selection and gap warnings.

- **OpenRouter model aliases** — recognized Gemini, Llama, Mistral and Gemma
  API names now receive their existing capability ratings, including known
  tier-3 models that previously fell back to an unclassified tier 3.

- OpenRouter tier lookup now normalizes vendor prefixes, variants and Claude
  version spelling using the provider context. Known frontier models can be
  selected as Speaker without rewriting their config or API model IDs.
  Capability-gap warnings exclude unclassified models while retaining their
  numeric fallback tier. Addresses the tier portion of #37.

- **`parliament ask --mock` now records the actual model for each member.**
  Mock-B and Mock-C were labeled `mock-v1` despite using `mock-v2` and `mock-v3`.
  The `--mock` paths now build their members from the one mock preset, through
  the same `build_parliament_from_config` path as a real config, so the label
  and the provider can no longer drift apart.

- **A broken keyring no longer crashes `parliament doctor`.** The `_keyring_*`
  helpers guarded their calls with `except Exception` so an unavailable keyring
  would degrade to "no stored key". Keyring's Rust-backed backends fail by
  panicking, and `pyo3_runtime.PanicException` inherits from `BaseException`,
  not `Exception` -- so the panic escaped the guard, propagated through
  `load_keys()` into `load_config()`, and took down `parliament doctor` and
  anything else that loads config. Affects any environment where keyring is
  installed but not functional: headless containers, CI runners, and installs
  missing the backend's native dependency. The helpers now catch
  `BaseException`, re-raising `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit`. Fixes #58.

- README development setup installed the non-existent `all` extra
  (`pip install -e ".[all,dev]"`); it now installs `".[dev]"`.
- **`ruff check .` means the same thing on every machine again.** Ruff 0.16
  widened its default rule set, so an unpinned install reported findings on
  unchanged code while an older one reported none. The dev extra was pinned to
  `<0.16` as a stopgap; the code is now clean under the wider defaults, so the
  pin is lifted and `ruff>=0.8` stands. `BLE001` is ignored project-wide with
  the reasoning recorded in `pyproject.toml`, since every one of its 18 sites
  is a deliberate boundary guard. Verified clean under both 0.15.8 and 0.16.8.
  Fixes #30.
- README and AGENTS.md still documented `verdict` as the built-in default
  Hansard level; it has been `minimal` since 0.2.0. Both now also state that
  saved `.md` files are always written at `archive` level.
- **A cancelled member no longer shrinks the debate.** `run_first_reading()` and
  `run_debate()` filtered gather results with `isinstance(r, Exception)`, which
  `CancelledError` fails (it is a `BaseException`), so a cancelled member was
  returned as if it were a `Response` — a function annotated `-> list[Response]`
  returning exception objects. Cancellation now aborts the debate instead. This
  also fixes the case that motivated #34: a Ctrl-C or an enclosing
  `asyncio.timeout` during First Reading dropped one member and kept going, so a
  timeout could return a confident verdict built from fewer members than
  configured. Provider failures still degrade as before. Fixes #34.
- `parliament ask` exits 130 with "Debate cancelled." on `CancelledError`, not
  just `KeyboardInterrupt`; previously a `CancelledError` escaping
  `asyncio.run()` missed the `except Exception` handler and printed a traceback.
- `parliament ask --json` no longer hides member failures. A provider that
  drops out mid-debate is reported on stderr instead of silently shrinking the
  response arrays.
- `parliament ask --json` now writes warnings and errors to stderr, keeping
  stdout a clean JSON document for `jq` and other consumers.
- **`openrouter` no longer borrows `OPENAI_API_KEY`.** Building a client for a
  wired OpenAI-compatible provider used to leave `api_key` unset when the
  vendor's own variable was missing, and the OpenAI SDK silently fell back to
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` -- so a real OpenAI credential would be posted to another
  vendor without anyone noticing. Construction now raises a clear error that
  names the missing variable and the recovery command, and the model picker
  uses the same rule (`openai_compatible_key()` returns `None` for any row
  that has its own `KEY_PROVIDERS` entry, instead of borrowing). The
  discovery-only rows (`groq`, `mistral`) keep the `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback,
  because they have no key home of their own. Fixes #48.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **First-run config wizard** — detects API keys, Ollama models, and system
  RAM on first launch and writes a tailored preset; 8 factory presets covering
  cloud-full, cloud-anthropic/openai/google, mixed, local-safe,
  mock-ollama-hint, and mock. Wizard fires interactively when stdin is a TTY;
  writes silently with a stderr notice on non-TTY (e.g. pipx postinstall).
  Fixes USE-20.
- **Resilient parliament** — provider failures drop that member and the debate
  continues with survivors; Division Speaker is chosen only from debate
  survivors with a retry loop; `is_fatal_provider_error()` gates reraise vs
  drop. Fixes USE-35.
- **Human-readable provider errors** — `providers/errors.py::format_provider_error()`
  covers OOM, timeout, 429/rate-limit, auth, and model-not-found across all
  three cloud providers. Fixes USE-21.
- **OS keyring integration** — `parliament keys set` saves to the OS native
  credential store (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring)
  with automatic fallback to `keys.env`; `parliament keys migrate` moves
  existing file keys to the keyring; `load_keys()` falls back to keyring for
  any key not found in the file. Fixes USE-31.
- **`parliament keys migrate`** — one-command migration of `keys.env` to the
  OS keyring; renames `keys.env → keys.env.bak` on full success.
- **`parliament update`** slash command + CLI subcommand — detects install
  type (editable git / pipx / pip-user / pip-system) and runs the matching
  upgrade command. Fixes USE-29.
- **Member viability section in `parliament doctor`** — lists each configured
  member with key/model status and aggregate RAM footprint check (via psutil).
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash default** — `gemini-2.5-flash` replaces
  `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` as the default Google model in presets and
  `MODEL_TIERS`. Fixes USE-36.
- **TUI result pager improvements** — Page Down (Space/PgDn/f), Page Up
  (PgUp/u), jump to top (g), jump to bottom (G) added to the Hansard viewer.

### Changed

- **Default Hansard level is now `minimal`** (recommendation only) for both
  display and new configs; saved `.md` files are always written at `archive`
  level (full synthesis + frontmatter) regardless of display level.
- **`parliament keys remove`** now clears the OS keyring in addition to
  `keys.env`.
- **Result pager footer** reads "Read full report: {path}" pointing to the
  saved archive-level Hansard file.

### Fixed

- Stray leading `**` markdown markers stripped from parsed Synthesis fields.
  Fixes USE-30.

### Dependencies

- Added `psutil>=5.9` (RAM detection in wizard and doctor).
- Added `keyring>=24.0` (OS credential store integration).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-18

First publishable release. Three LLM members debate a question through First
Reading, Debate, and Division phases and produce a structured Hansard verdict.

### Added

- **Parliamentary debate engine** — three-phase pipeline (First Reading,
  Debate, Division) with parallel provider calls and a Speaker synthesis step.
- **Providers** — Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Ollama (via OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint), plus a deterministic Mock provider for testing.
- **Curses TUI** — interactive dashboard with member picker, settings screen,
  slash-command palette, and Hansard result viewer.
- **CLI** (`parliament ask`) — one-shot debates with Rich output and a live
  debate renderer (spinner + elapsed timer per pending member).
- **`parliament doctor`** — health check covering Python version, curses
  availability, terminal capabilities, config initialization, provider SDKs,
  API keys, and Ollama daemon reachability. Available as a slash command in
  the TUI as well.
- **Hansard detail levels** — `HansardLevel` enum (`minimal`, `verdict`,
  `archive`, `full`) controls how much of the debate is rendered. Configurable
  via `--hansard` CLI flag, `PARLIAMENT_HANSARD_LEVEL` env var, config file,
  or TUI settings screen (with `--verbose` kept as a back-compat alias).
- **Slash commands** — `/help`, `/doctor`, `/update`, `/history`, `/copy`,
  speaker-override, and members-picker shortcuts.
- **`/update`** — pull latest code for editable git installs from inside the
  TUI; shows a centered quit-notice before exit so users see the result.
- **Render diagnostic script** (`scripts/diagnose-render.py`) — verifies
  terminal colour and spinner behaviour for debugging environment issues.
- **Windows support** — `windows-curses` dependency, asyncio Windows event
  loop policy, forced Rich terminal mode, cross-platform path resolution in
  `/update`.
- **Docs** — `AGENTS.md` (source of truth), `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md`
  pointers, `RELEASING.md`, per-OS install instructions, hansard-redesign
  plan and spec.

### Fixed

- Curses thread race on Windows — all curses drawing now happens on the main
  thread; the worker thread only mutates renderer state.
- Synthesis parser now handles markdown (`### CONSENSUS`) and bold
  (`**CONSENSUS**`) section headers in addition to plain `CONSENSUS:`.
- Settings screen UX — left arrow cycles hansard level; `save_dir` requires
  Enter to enter edit mode (no accidental edits from focus changes).
- Curses colour pairs are re-initialised after the live renderer resets them,
  so the dashboard regains colour on return.
- Rich colours forced on Windows (`force_terminal=True`, `legacy_windows=False`).
- `/update` resolves `file://` URLs from `direct_url.json` correctly on
  Windows (uses `url2pathname`, not `urlparse`).

### Notes

- Default config is created at `~/.parliament/config.yaml` (Linux/macOS) or
  `%USERPROFILE%\.parliament\config.yaml` (Windows) on first run.
- API keys are stored in `keys.env` next to the config, `chmod 0600` on Unix.
- Test suite: 321 tests passing under `pytest -q`; `ruff check .` clean.
